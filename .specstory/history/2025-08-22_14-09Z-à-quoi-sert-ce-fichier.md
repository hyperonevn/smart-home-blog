<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering Utterances.js Usage**

I’m checking if Utterances.js is used directly on the post page, so I'll scan `pages/[slug].js` without needing parallel calls. It feels like I should include a status update before making tool calls, since we've done that before. But maybe we don’t need it this time? Instead, I can answer based on the existing content of Utterances.js. I’ll aim to include a brief code snippet to illustrate the script injection lines, using the required line notation with lines 13-21.
**Reviewing Code Editing Guidelines**

I'm thinking about the instruction to preserve file indentation when editing code, but maybe that's not so relevant here. It seems I should include a small summary at the end as per the summary_spec, especially since the developer instructions mention status updates and summaries for tool calls. We did that earlier with a one-liner. I wonder if I need to provide another status update before ending? A brief note like, "I've read the file; here's its purpose" would be good, but I should keep it minimal. It might not be necessary to create to-do lists for this read-only question, so I think I’ll skip that and focus on succinct bullet points. I'll also mention how it appends scripts to `#comments` and performs clean-up.
**Setting Up Utterances**

I'm reviewing the usage of the `Utterances` service, noting that `issueTerm` maps to GitHub Issues and the layout toggles `md:-ml-16`. To configure it, `BLOG.comment.utterancesConfig.repo` must specify owner/repo, but I need to keep this minimal. The theme is determined by `BLOG.appearance`, automatically adapting to color schemes. I’ll also mention it renders a container div with the id `comments`. For my final answer, I’ll include a brief explanation, a code snippet citation, and a status update at the start like, "Je viens de lire le fichier; voici à quoi il sert." Plus, a concise summary bullet should wrap it up nicely!</details></think>

Je viens de lire `components/Utterances.js`; voici à quoi il sert.

- Il intègre le widget de commentaires Utterances (basé sur GitHub Issues) dans les pages.
- Il choisit automatiquement le thème (clair/sombre/auto) selon `BLOG.appearance`.
- Il injecte le script Utterances dans le conteneur `#comments` et nettoie à l’unmount.
- Props utiles:
  - `issueTerm`: la clé de mapping vers l’issue GitHub (ex. pathname, url, title, etc.).
  - `layout`: ajuste la marge (`fullWidth` supprime le décalage).
- Il lit le dépôt cible dans `BLOG.comment.utterancesConfig.repo`.

Extrait clé (injection du script):
```13:21:/Users/kaba/Code/Formance/nobelium/components/Utterances.js
    const script = document.createElement('script')
    const anchor = document.getElementById('comments')
    script.setAttribute('src', 'https://utteranc.es/client.js')
    script.setAttribute('crossorigin', 'anonymous')
    script.setAttribute('async', true)
    script.setAttribute('repo', BLOG.comment.utterancesConfig.repo)
    script.setAttribute('issue-term', issueTerm)
    script.setAttribute('theme', theme)
    anchor.appendChild(script)
```

- En bref: ce fichier rend un bloc de commentaires Utterances, configuré par `useConfig()`, pour afficher des discussions liées aux articles via GitHub Issues.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating file content**

I need to check pages/[slug].js and possibly pages/index.js, but I'm not sure if both are necessary. My first step will be to search for the string "Utterances" to gather relevant information. I'll perform a parallel tool use to grep for both "Utterances" and its lower-case version. Additionally, I want to read from pages/[slug].js and lib/config.js to get a comprehensive understanding. It feels like a solid plan!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Executing tool calls**

I need to perform parallel tool calls to search for "Utterances" and "utterancesConfig" as well as looking for the comment provider. Following the guidelines, I prefer using the codebase_search for exploration, but since I’m looking for exact tokens like "Utterances," I think using grep is appropriate. I’ll proceed by running both: grep for "Utterances" along with "utterancesConfig" and the "comment" provider. Let’s get those three grep calls done in parallel!</details></think>

Je vais chercher toutes les références à `Utterances` et `utterancesConfig` pour les supprimer proprement, puis je procéderai aux edits nécessaires.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Managing Comment Configuration**

It seems like there are some changes needed regarding the `utterancesConfig` property. While the comment providers suggest removing it, I think it's safe to keep for now. They asked to eliminate dependencies and possibly remove mentions in the README. We also need to ensure that `Utterances.js` is not imported anywhere, and it looks like there's just some leftover configuration. I'll delete `components/Utterances.js` since it's not necessary anymore. We should also check that `utterances` isn't listed in package.json.
**Cleaning Up Code**

It looks like the only reference to Utterances is in the `Utterances.js` file at line 18, and once that file is removed, there won’t be any remaining code references. I’m considering whether to remove the comment about supporting providers like Gitalk and Cusdis; it might be cleaner to remove it alongside the `utterancesConfig` block. Additionally, I should check if we need to remove the `Comments` import in `pages/[slug].js` since `Comments.js` has already been deleted, even though it’s not directly tied to Utterances.
**Improving Build Process**

I think we should remove the Comments import and `<Comments>` usage to keep the build green, especially since there’s a broken import. The guidelines instruct ensuring a green build and running lints after changes. We can run lints using the ESLint tool on the changed files since it's not required to run 'next build'. Our to-do includes cleaning up the Utterances configuration, so the plan is to delete the `components/Utterances.js` file and edit `blog.config.js` to remove the `utterancesConfig` object, making sure to keep the correct indentation and style.
**Applying File Changes**

I need to apply a patch to remove lines 50-52, which seems simpler than editing directly. The instructions say to prefer using the `apply_patch` tool for editing files, and I've already read the file. I'll make sure the context lines are exact for the patch removal. We can also decide about removing the comment about supporting providers; it could stay as it isn't necessary to remove. Next, I'll check for any other occurrences of 'utterances' to clean up. The todo list gets updated after completing tasks, including running lints on changed files.
**Running Lint Checks**

I need to run `read_lints` to catch any project linter errors, probably from ESLint. The immediate task is to remove the file and the config as requested. I’ll proceed with deleting `components/Utterances.js` and applying a patch to `blog.config.js`. After that, I’ll run `read_lints` on those files and check `pages/[slug].js` for any lint errors, particularly concerning the Comments import, which might cause issues since `Comments.js` is already deleted. While the user didn’t explicitly ask to remove the comments feature, it makes sense to address this proactively. I'll focus on our changes first and suggest any necessary fixes if lints point out unresolved imports.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing code dependencies**

Since Comments.js is deleted, I notice references to Utterances are only in that file or removed code. There's still a mention in blog.config.js that may need attention. I should remove the utterancesConfig key since an empty provider means it won’t use anything. However, “removing dependencies” could also refer to package dependencies for Utterances, even though there's no NPM package. I need to update the Comments usage in pages/[slug].js since it’s still imported, but the focus is on removing Utterances, not Comments.
**Assessing Comments usage**

Having the Comments import could lead to errors, especially since components/Comments.js is deleted. The user might have removed Comments intentionally, so it's worth considering updating pages/[slug].js to remove its usage as part of the comment system overhaul, including Utterances. Their request likely means to remove Utterances and any associated dependencies, with Comments being a dependency. Although I’m hesitant to make broad changes unless necessary, the repo seems broken due to the Comments import. I should check for a new Comments alternative while deciding on removing the import to fix the build.
**Planning code updates**

The todo spec indicates we should run builds and tests after making code edits. Since I don't have a direct tool to run builds, I can propose a command for that. However, I should consider updating pages/[slug].js to remove Comments usage since Comments.js is deleted, even though the user's request didn't specify it. To keep the build green, necessary changes are essential. The developer instructions suggest running lints and fixes too. The read_lints tool is available to check for errors, so I should run that. First, I’ll update the TODO and set "cleanup-utterances-config" as in-progress before proceeding to remove the `utterancesConfig` block from blog.config.js.
**Deciding on dependency removal**

I suspect that the code might reference BLOG.comment.utterancesConfig, but since Comments.js is deleted, there are no active references. To fulfill the request to "remove dependencies," it's safe to delete the utterancesConfig property.

I should also eliminate any imports to Utterances from files since we previously checked for them in components/Utterances.js which has been removed. Next, I need to address Comments usage as it could still cause build errors. Even though that wasn't specified, it’s necessary to avoid import issues in pages/[slug].js. Lastly, I won’t need to remove any npm packages since Utterances relied on script injection rather than a package dependency.
**Planning necessary edits**

Our steps are clear: First, I’ll edit blog.config.js to remove the `utterancesConfig` property and optionally a mention of 'utterances' in comments. Next, I’ve already removed components/Utterances.js. Then, I need to address the Comments import and usage in pages/[slug].js, where it’s indeed still referenced. Given that Comments.js is deleted, I’ll remove both the import statement and the usage block. There’s a need to verify other files, but pages/index.js is good. I’ll run the read_lints check afterward. 

I'll apply the patches sequentially to ensure reliability, since the edits are in different files. After editing, I’ll run read_lints specifically on those files for efficiency. I'll also check package.json for any unnecessary dependencies linked to "gitalk," but since the ask focuses on Utterances, I won’t modify that. Let’s get going!</details></think>
