<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Searching for patterns in code**

I'm planning to run parallel searches for specific patterns in the code. I want to look for instances of "from 'dayjs," "require('dayjs," and "dayjs/locale." Additionally, I'll check the contents of the "lib/dayjs.js" file. I can call the grep function multiple times in parallel to make this efficient. It should give me a comprehensive view of how Day.js is being utilized!</details></think>

Je vais rechercher où et comment `dayjs` et ses locales sont importés et vérifier la config Next/Webpack pour comprendre pourquoi un fichier `.d.ts` est parsé. Ensuite je proposerai un correctif ciblé.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating date component**

I think it's best to make minimal changes, like updating `components/FormattedDate.js` to import from `.../${lang}.js`. I also need to consider removing 'transpilePackages: ['dayjs']' in next.config, although it may not be necessary. The primary goal is to fix the error quickly, so I'll go ahead and open `components/FormattedDate.js` now. It's exciting to tackle this! Let's get this sorted.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving build error**

I need to deal with a build error in Next.js 15.5.0, specifically with Webpack. It arises from parsing a TypeScript declaration file located in `node_modules/dayjs/locale/index.d.ts`. The error indicates that Webpack is misinterpreting this file as a JavaScript module, likely due to a dynamic import statement. The import path should lead to a JavaScript file, typically `index.js`. It seems Webpack isn't respecting the `"types"` field in the package.json, leading it to mistakenly attempt to parse the `.d.ts` file.
**Investigating transpile issues**

I think the issue might stem from the `transpilePackages: ['dayjs']` setting in `next.config.js`, which causes Next to transpile the dayjs package and inadvertently includes TypeScript files. Webpack tries to parse the `.d.ts` file, leading to parse errors. The dynamic import context could be causing Webpack to utilize `require.context` and scan all file types, including `.d.ts`, even though it typically doesn't include them. Next.js configuration might allow `.ts` and `.tsx`, but there might be no specific filter for `.d.ts` files causing these parsing attempts.
**Addressing Webpack parsing issues**

Even though Webpack typically ignores `.d.ts` files because no loader processes them, it seems to have tried to parse one, resulting in an error due to TypeScript syntax. A common workaround is to specify the extension in dynamic imports, so instead of importing from `dayjs/locale/*`, I could revise it to `import('dayjs/locale/${lang}.js')`. However, to avoid issues, I might also consider using `dayjs.locale(lang)` with the `LocalizedFormat` plugin instead. I'll need to update `FormattedDate.js` on line 16 and check if `transpilePackages: ['dayjs']` is necessary since Next 15 uses SWC for TypeScript.
**Configuring Webpack**

We can set up Webpack to ignore `.d.ts` files either by using `module.rules` with an ignore loader or by removing `.d.ts` from `resolve.extensions`. However, a simpler solution is to just add `.js` to the dynamic import. Since this change is minor, I think I can skip creating a todo list. I need to follow the status update guidelines, including updates before and after any tool calls. I'll edit `components/FormattedDate.js` using `apply_patch`, ensuring I maintain the correct two-space indentation in the file.
**Making changes to imports**

It seems we need to ensure we preserve the indentation style, which appears to be two spaces. Since I'm only changing line 16, I'll use `apply_patch` to implement that. The parsing issue arose from trying to read `index.d.ts` due to dynamic imports, so switching to `.js` should resolve this. I should verify that this is the only dynamic import in `FormattedDate`. I’ll also run lints on the edited file afterward to check for errors. 

The update will change the import statement to:

From:
`loaded[lang] ??= import('dayjs/locale/${lang}').then(`

To:
`loaded[lang] ??= import('dayjs/locale/${lang}.js').then(`

Let’s go ahead and apply that patch!</details></think>

Je vais modifier l’import dynamique des locales Day.js pour n’inclure que les fichiers `.js`, ce qui évitera que Webpack essaie de parser les `.d.ts`. Ensuite je vérifierai les erreurs de linter sur le fichier modifié.

---

- Je viens d’actualiser l’import dynamique pour cibler explicitement les locales en `.js`, afin d’éviter que Webpack tente de parser le fichier de types `.d.ts` de Day.js. Aucun problème de linter détecté.

- Pour vérifier: relancez le build. Si une autre occurrence d’import dynamique des locales existe, on fera la même correction.

Résumé
- Changement clé dans `components/FormattedDate.js`: `import(\`dayjs/locale/${lang}.js\`)` au lieu de `import(\`dayjs/locale/${lang}\`)`. Cela corrige l’erreur “Module parse failed: Unexpected token (3:8)” liée aux `.d.ts` de Day.js avec Next 15/Webpack.
