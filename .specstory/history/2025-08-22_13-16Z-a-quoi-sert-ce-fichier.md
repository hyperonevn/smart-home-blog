Je vais ouvrir `components/Vercel.js` pour voir son contenu et t’expliquer clairement à quoi il sert.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Optimizing tool calls for grep search**

I want to quickly search for "Vercel" imports using functions.grep. It seems like I could maximize efficiency by running just one grep for 'Vercel' across the workspace. There’s also a note about including micro-updates when making tool calls. Since we’ve already had one micro-update before an earlier call, it seems fine. But for this next grep, I should give another micro-update, even though a simple explanation might suffice. Clarity is important!
**Preparing code documentation**

I should create bullet points outlining what the code does, when it’s used, and how to modify or remove it. Including a short code snippet could be helpful too! According to the citing_code spec, I need to format the citation using the "startLine:endLine:filepath" style. I could include the relevant lines for the anchor and SVG part. Maybe using two code blocks would be beneficial to show both the top and bottom sections, keeping the answer minimal yet informative.
**Writing React component description**

I have a reminder to keep file indentation in mind, but since we're writing in French, let’s focus on that. I want to explain that this is a functional React component called `Vercel`. It renders a link to vercel.com with UTM parameters, opens in a new tab and includes the `rel="noreferrer"` attribute. It also contains the Vercel logo in SVG format. 

The component could display a "Powered by Vercel" badge or deployment link, typically in a footer. It has an accessible label of "Vercel" and can be used by importing and placing `<Vercel />` in your layout or footer. To modify it, one could change the URL, remove UTM parameters, replace the SVG, or add classes. I'll also check where it's used in the project, although it seems like it may no longer be referenced as the git status shows certain files deleted. I'll grep to confirm!</details></think>

Je vais vérifier où `components/Vercel.js` est utilisé pour te dire s’il est effectivement affiché quelque part.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing React component usage**

I'm noting that there’s a React component that renders a Vercel badge/link for attribution, but it isn't currently used anywhere. A search using grep only found it in the README and its own file, suggesting it may have previously been in a deleted Footer or Header. We need to state that it’s currently unused and provide a status update: "J'ai ouvert le fichier et vérifié ses usages. Il n'est référencé nulle part." I might propose deleting it if it's truly not needed.
**Explaining the file's purpose**

The question is asking, "What is the purpose of this file?" I want to clarify its function and note that it currently appears unused. Here’s my structured response:

- Status update: "J'ai ouvert le fichier et vérifié son utilisation."
- Key explanation:
  - It's a functional React component, `Vercel`.
  - It renders a link to vercel.com with an SVG badge saying "Powered by Vercel."
  - It's designed to provide credit or a call-to-action in a footer or similar location.
  - Currently, it’s not referenced in the code, meaning it's inactive.
  
I could optionally suggest where to reintroduce it or propose removing it. I’ll include a summary in bullet points, mentioning the tracking UTM parameters as well.</details></think>

Je viens d’ouvrir `components/Vercel.js` et de vérifier ses usages dans le projet; il n’est référencé nulle part actuellement.

- C’est un composant React (`Vercel`) qui affiche un badge/logo Vercel sous forme de SVG, cliquable, pointant vers `https://vercel.com?utm_source=Craigary&utm_campaign=oss` (avec paramètres UTM).
- Il sert typiquement à montrer “Powered by Vercel” (souvent en pied de page).
- Dans l’état actuel, il est non utilisé dans le code (seulement mentionné dans `README.md`). Probablement il était affiché via un `Footer`/`Header` auparavant.

Résumé:
- **But**: composant d’attribution Vercel (logo + lien).
- **Statut**: non utilisé dans l’app à présent. Vous pouvez soit l’ôter, soit l’insérer (ex. dans un footer) si vous souhaitez afficher le crédit.
